# Web GPU (wgpu) Excercises
* Source Material - [Rust wgpu Graphics Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_UrKDEhALdJS0VrLPn7dqC5A4W1vCAUT)

NOTE: This fabuluous tutorial is using an older version of winit and wgpu, so there will be some differences between the Rust implementations if you decide to check out the playlist. Make sure that you double check the versions in the turorial and in these exercises before trying to copy these implementations.
