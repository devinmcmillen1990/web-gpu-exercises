## Buffers
A buffer is a contiguous chunk of data on the GPU. Buffers can be used to store things like structs, arrays, graphs, trees, etc.

[Index Buffer](./ex4b_index_buffers/README.md)

## Challenge
Create a more complex shape than the one we made (aka. more than three triangles) using a vertex buffer and an index buffer. Toggle between the two with the space key.
