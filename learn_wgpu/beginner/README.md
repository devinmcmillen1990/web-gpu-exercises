# Learn WGPU
[Learn WGPU](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/)

This is a modern tutorial that covers [Rust WGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) which is an implementation of the [WebGPU API Specification](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu). 

# Excercises
The exercises will differ from the Learn WGPU tutorials, because we won't be working with the WASM implementation.
