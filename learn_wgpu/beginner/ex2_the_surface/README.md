# The Surface
(TODO)

# Demo
Executing a ```cargo build | cargo run``` will run the application rendering a blueish screen.

Keybindings are the same from the previous exercise.

# Challenge
Modify the input() method to capture mouse events, and update the clear color using that. Hint: you'll probably need to use WindowEvent::CursorMoved.
